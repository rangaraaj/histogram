# Twitter Histogram

## Question

Using an appropriate micro-framework as a foundation (Silex, Sinatra),
connect to Twitterâ€™s API and return a JSON-encoded array containing hour ->
tweet counts for a given user, to determine what hour of the day they are most
active. The application should consist of at least 3 endpoints:

* / -> will respond with Try /hello/:name as text
* /hello/BarackObama -> will respond with Hello BarackObama as text
* /histogram/Ferrari -> will respond with a JSON structure displaying the
number of tweets per hour of the day

The app will be reviewed based on the appropriate use of OO and SOLID
principles.
